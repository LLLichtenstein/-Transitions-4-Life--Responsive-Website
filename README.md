# Transitions

Transitions 4 Life is a responsive website I created in HTML5 and CSS3.

The website is directed toward disabled individuals (and their family) who are transitioning from high school to college or the work world.

Transitions 4 Life website can be viewed at https://lllichtenstein.github.io/-Transitions-4-Life--Responsive-Website/

Code for the final version of the website is in the Transitions Final branch.
